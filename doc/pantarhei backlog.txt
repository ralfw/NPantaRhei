Topics to address in future increments
------------

Move serial/parallel execution to special operations. No annotations necessary anymore. Makes for more flexibility in terms of threadpools
for certain operations.


Add causality push/pop as a special operations. Does the exec engine need to know about causalities? Or can they be completely handled within
operations?


Add join as a special operation (with the number of inputs as a ctor param). Watch out: the join needs to be thread-safe.


For functional units producing many results: do they really need to produce all results at once?
That would make them use a thread for a long time. But if such a functional unit produces an IEnum using yield,
then there is a chance of executing it in a piece meal fashion.
However: if the IEnum would just get delivered to a consumer who then "pulls" on it, the producer would just
execute on the consumer´s thread. Rather each element of the IEnum should be scheduled as an individual message.
That way each "pull" could be executed sequentially on a different thread.
This could work, if there was no single loop over the IEnum (a single foreach), but rather an element by element
pull: a single element gets pulled from the IEnum and passed on to the consumer. Then the remaining IEnum gets
resend to the pulling functional unit for the next pull.
This could be a pattern operation or it could be a functionality to attach via a port annotation.
Or... maybe the producer could return the IEnum wrapped in some special object which the Runtime interprets?
Goal: Retain simplicity of IEnum for producer and consumer. But avoid processing all elements on same thread as consumer.


Explicitly stop async/parallel/serial operations when runtime is stopped


Create contract project with stuff that implementors of operation would find useful


What happens on exec engine exceptions?
	Shut down - send exeception to error port first


Starting/pausing/stopping background threads and running operations
	How to halt the whole processing in a gentle way?
	Persistence of operations state and exec engine queues?
	Propagate to background operations.
	Can operations be notified? Should they need to conform to an interface?
	
Breakpoints
	selective based on port name filters
	

Tracing
	provide a log port on runtime
	selective tracing based on port name filters
	serialize any data graph
	How to convert any message to text?

Slow-motion
	slow down flow of messages

Consistency checking
	are operations missing?
	are there unused operations?
	are operations connected in a type safe manner?
		compare types of ports; no explicit types on streams are needed for this
	do ports used in streams match ports of operations?
		operations need to publish their ports; meta-data

Create stream list from DSL

Visualize stream list

Operation adapters
	EBC
	method with out param
	methods of a class
		static
		instance
		only annotated with an attribute?
		allow annotation for operation name and port names

Compile stream list from assemblies
	read from resources?
	
	
Take from queue according to a pattern
	This is supposed to emulate Erlang where "processes" can take from their mailboxes in order - but are not limited to the mailbox head.



---------------------------------
Implemented/solved:


Standard operation for syncing message processing

Port on exec engine to listen on all messages flowing.

Exception handling in exec engine: exception port

Remove sync mode from exec engine. Should always run async with regard to environment.

Parallel processing on many threads
	but still sequential processing of message with each operation
	do this with a special standard operation

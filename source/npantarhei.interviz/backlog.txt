::Build runtime and interviz on a flow DSL compiler producing an AST.
Besides the AST there should be some structure to put AST elements in relation to the source.
So maybe it´s a "structured source tree.
	-runtime: loading of flows and creating streams with qualified ports
			  how can configuration be separated in general?
				FlowRuntime
				FlowRuntimeConfiguration
	-interviz: displaying graphs, navigation

::Display comments in graph. But only comments in the same line as a flow name or stream, e.g.

// dont display this comment
F // but display this next to node
.in, A
A, B // and display this next to edge
B, .out

Where should flow name comments go in the graph? In the box or next to the box?
Stream comments can become labels of edges.


::Word wrap flow names in their boxes.
A first attempt failed - but maybe it still can be made to work?


::Allow sorting of flow names in combobox: alphabetically or in order of definition.


::Display all flow ports on the same level in graph (on top/bottom of flow).


::Provide drill down on graph. Does GraphViz deliver box coordinates?
